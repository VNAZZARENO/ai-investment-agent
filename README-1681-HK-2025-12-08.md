**Decision Framework Applied**:

```
=== DECISION LOGIC ===
ZONE: MODERATE RISK (1.0-1.99)
Default Decision: HOLD
Actual Decision: BUY
Data Vacuum Penalty Applied: YES
Override: YES (Adjusted Health 87.5% >= 50% AND Adjusted Growth 100% >= 65% AND Risk 1.0 <= 1.5)
======================
```

### POSITION-LEVEL CONSTRAINTS

**Maximum Position Size**: **1.5%**
- **Basis**: **Data Vacuum (Significant Missing Data)**
- **Impact**: Position capped at 1.5% due to missing EV/EBITDA, FCF Yield, and Debt serviceability metrics, despite strong adjusted scores.

### FINAL EXECUTION PARAMETERS

**Action**: **BUY**
**Recommended Position Size**: **1.5%**
**Entry**: Limit orders in the **14.00 - 14.25 HKD** range (targeting Bollinger Lower Band support).
**Stop loss**: **13.50 HKD** (Close below recent low).
**Profit targets**: **15.40 HKD** (50-day SMA), **17.45 HKD** (Recent High).

### DECISION RATIONALE

1.  **Strong Fundamentals**: Consun Pharma exhibits robust adjusted scores (Health 87.5%, Growth 100%) with excellent profitability (ROE 23.6%) and liquidity (Current Ratio 3.54).
2.  **Undiscovered Value**: The stock is undiscovered (Zero StockTwits/Reddit activity) and trades at a compelling valuation (P/E 11.4, PEG 0.62).
3.  **Risk Management**: While the D/E ratio of 5.45 is flagged as a risk (+1.0), the discrepancy between ROE/ROA implies actual leverage may be manageable or structural. However, the absence of key valuation and debt metrics (EV/EBITDA, NetDebt/EBITDA) triggers the **Data Vacuum** protocol.
4.  **Override Logic**: The stock falls into the Moderate Risk zone (Risk 1.0), but qualifies for a BUY override due to superior Health and Growth scores. We execute this buy with a strict 1.5% cap to account for the data gaps.
